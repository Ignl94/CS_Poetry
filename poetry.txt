My tiny box of things
A tiny box for dreams
Inside you'll find some tiny jewels, on a couple tiny strings
You'll also find a pack of mints
And a couple wads of gum
Inside my tiny box
If you ever dare to look
You'll come across a couple keys, hidden in a couple books
I also have a jar of honey, that I got from friendly bees
I also have an aloe plant, for when I scrape my knees
Inside my tiny box
I also keep my paints
An easel, some solvent, and I also keep my vape
Inside my tiny box
I hold my favorite home
A giant place with many rooms
Where I can be alone
